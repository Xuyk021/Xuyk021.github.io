    "abstract": "Elderly people in China face dietary imbalance due to economic constraints as a developing country, coupled with a lack of motivation for a balanced diet. Research reveals that they have more diverse menus when cooking for their extended families. To address this, I developed a system using intelligent projection technology to assist them in meal preparation. By simulating the scenario of a large family cooking together, it ignites their interest in cooking for themselves. This system enables natural interaction and lowers the learning curve.",
