    "abstract": "As autonomous driving technology continues to evolve, an increasing number of passengers are seeking a more relaxing travel experience. In addition to existing features such as voice control, soothing music, and automatic seat adjustments, interior lighting can also contribute to a more relaxing interactive experience for passengers.\n\nTo this end, this project has developed a new interaction system designed for both autonomous drivers and regular passengers familiar with these vehicle conditions. The system enables natural interaction through gestures and provides relaxing feedback through lighting.",
