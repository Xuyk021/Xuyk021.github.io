    "abstract": "Climate change communication often struggles to make complex data accessible and personally relevant. We present EnvVISTA, a work-in-progress serious game that combines geovisualization, gamified exploration, and large language models (LLMs) to support playful engagement with real-world environmental data. Using datasets from New York City, the system enables users to explore issues like air quality and vegetation through interactive maps, AI-generated narratives, and conversational interactions. LLMs serve multiple roles—from storytelling to insight evaluation—creating a dynamic, responsive interaction loop. EnvVISTA demonstrates a novel approach to environmental data storytelling and offers a testbed for future research on AI-assisted, emotionally resonant climate games.",
